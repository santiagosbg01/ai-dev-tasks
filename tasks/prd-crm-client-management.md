# üöÄ Custom CRM for Client Management (Without Sales Pipeline)

## 1. üßæ Elevator Pitch

We‚Äôre building a **bespoke CRM** focused on managing existing client accounts and empowering your KAM team. It consolidates all client data‚Äîcontracts, billing, support tickets‚Äîand provides tools to monitor activity, automate alerts, and integrate seamlessly with your ecosystem. No sales pipeline, just robust account management.

---

## 2. üéØ Target Users & Stakeholders

* **Primary Users**:

  * KAMs / **Farmers** tracking client work and relationships
  * Managers and Executives monitoring individual and team performance
* **Stakeholders**:

  * Product/Tech leads (implementation & data flow)
  * Finance team (billing / NetSuite integration)
  * Customer support (Zoho Desk integration)
  * Regional operations teams (template consistency)

---

## 3. üß© Functional Requirements

### A. Core Capabilities

* Unified **360¬∞ client view**: contracts, billing, tickets, tasks, past interactions
* Full **traceability** of client-related activity (who did what, when)
* **Account-based metrics**: PLV, last touch, usage, support history

### B. Activity Monitoring & Reporting

* Activity tracking per **Farmer** (KAM) and per team
* Views by individual and aggregate performance
* Dashboards and reports for Hunting vs. Farming needs‚Äîeven though no pipeline stages

### C. Templates & Workflow Automation

* **Standardized templates and workflows** across regions
* Workflow automation: recurring tasks, handoffs, alerts
* Prebuilt templates for common processes (e.g. billing review, support check‚Äëin)

### D. Automated Alerts & Reminders

* Notifications for:

  * Upcoming tasks
  * Contract renewal dates
  * Support inactivity or high ticket volume
* Enforced **transition criteria** within certain account workflows (e.g., after last invoice, mark ‚Äúinactive‚Äù), even without a formal funnel

### E. Integration Requirements (Must-Haves)

* API / two-way sync with:

  * **Typeform** for lead capture (if needed for pre‚Äëexisting clients or forms)
  * **WeTrust (WeeTrust?)** for electronic signatures
  * **Google Workspace**: Gmail & Calendar integration
  * **Zoho Desk**: support ticket syncing and case tracking
  * **NetSuite**: financial data (billing, revenue, invoices)
  * **Duemint** (Chile collections tool; validate for other countries)
* **Open API layer** for custom integrations (e.g. Looker dashboards, internal systems)

### F. Data Quality & Governance

* Customizable data schemas per account type or region
* Mandatory fields enforcement at record creation/update
* Role-based access control: Executive, Manager, Admin
* Audit logs for changes

### G. Reporting & KPIs

* Prebuilt KPIs: revenue per account, churn risk, CSAT/NPS, support load
* Scheduled reports (daily/weekly/monthly), dashboards
* Custom KPI definitions per regional strategy

### H. Bonus / Future Features (Optional)

* **AI-assisted summaries** of ticket history or client interactions
* Smart upsell or renewal recommendations
* KAM health score over time
